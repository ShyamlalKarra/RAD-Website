The group's research mission is to make it easier to obtain systems with reliable correctness guarantees.

To this end, I am developing methods and tools for the rigorous analysis and design of software and hardware, based on formal verification and automatic synthesis.

Application domains include concurrent and distributed systems, security-critical software and hardware, and any kind of system that is expected to scale with the number of users or participants.
